# Student-Grading-System-Java
The **Student Grading System** is a Java program that calculates and displays a student's grade based on their marks in three subjects. It takes student names and marks as input, calculates the total and average, and assigns a grade (A, B, C, D, F) based on the average. The results are then displayed for each student.
