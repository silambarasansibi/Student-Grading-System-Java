# Student-Grading-System-Java
The **Student Grading System** is a Java program that calculates and displays a student's grade based on their marks in three subjects. It takes student names and marks as input, calculates the total and average, and assigns a grade (A, B, C, D, F) based on the average. The results are then displayed for each student.

Features:

Input student name and marks for different subjects.
Calculate total marks and average.
Determine grade based on average marks.
Display the result for each student.

How it works:

Input Student Details: The program asks for the number of students, then for each student, it requests their name and marks for three subjects.
Grade Calculation: Based on the average marks, the program assigns a grade (A, B, C, D, F).
Display Results: After calculating the total marks, average, and grade, the program prints the results.

Features You Can Add Later:

Implement saving results to a file (e.g., CSV or text file).
Handle invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric input).
Allow for more than three subjects.

This project is simple but helps you practice handling user input, basic arithmetic, and decision-making in Java.
